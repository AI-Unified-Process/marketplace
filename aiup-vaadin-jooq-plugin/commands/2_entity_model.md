Create an entity model (docs/entity_model.md) based on docs/requirements.md as a Markdown file.
The file must include a Mermaid.js ERD diagram that shows the entity names (no columns) and the relationships between
the entities.

After the diagram insert a section per entity.
Each section contains a Markdown table with the column names and their descriptions.
Each column defines the data type, including validation rules and column lengths.

By default, use sequences for the primary keys.
